                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, 
                the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical 
                rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous 
                population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by 
                fishing or agriculture.

                Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, 
                four-star resort. There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed 
                and breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by 
                the Tanitian government.

                Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to 
                visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a 
                local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining 
                in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at 
                a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, 
                visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be 
                operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, 
                which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.

                Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native 
                architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. 
                Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in 
                the rainforest, or visits to Taniti’s active volcano.

                Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise 
                ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a 
                small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in 
                the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the 
                island within the next few years.

                    Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas,

                    Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and

                <li>
                    Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen.
